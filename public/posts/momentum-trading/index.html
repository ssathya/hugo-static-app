The concept of selling underperforming assets and purchasing those on the rise is enticing, but it directly challenges the timeless Wall Street principle of “buy low, sell high.”\nThis article explores the concept of momentum investing, examining its advantages and drawbacks.\nWhile Richard Driehaus wasn’t the pioneer of momentum investing, he refined the approach and implemented it as the cornerstone of his fund management strategy.\nHe believed that greater profits could be achieved by “buying high and selling higher,” rather than purchasing undervalued stocks and waiting for the market to recognize their worth.\nWhat is Momentum investing? Momentum investing capitalizes on market volatility by entering short-term positions in rising stocks and selling them at the first signs of decline. The investor then reallocates the capital to fresh opportunities. In this analogy, market volatility resembles ocean waves, with a momentum investor riding the crest of one wave and swiftly transitioning to the next before the first wave crashes.\nMomentum investors also exploit the phenomenon of investor herding, positioning themselves at the forefront to profit and exit before the crowd. Below, you’ll find a table outlining how momentum investing compares with other popular strategies.\nBuilding blocks for Momentum Investing Navigating momentum markets demands advanced risk management strategies to tackle challenges such as volatility, overcrowding, and unforeseen pitfalls that can erode profits. However, traders often disregard these principles, driven by a deep-seated fear of missing out on rallies or sell-offs while others secure substantial gains. These guidelines can be summarized into five key components:\nOpt for liquid securities. Carefully manage risks during trade entries and exits. Aim to enter positions early. Select your holding period judiciously. Execute your exit with precision. Opt for liquid securities When employing momentum strategies, prioritize liquid securities. Avoid leveraged or inverse ETFs, as their price movements often fail to accurately reflect underlying indices or futures markets due to their intricate construction. While regular funds are reliable trading options, they typically deliver smaller percentage gains and losses compared to individual stocks.\nFocus on securities with a daily trading dollar volume is high, as many well-known stocks meet this standard. Occasionally, low-float stocks can become highly liquid when significant news breaks, driving heightened volatility and attracting diverse market participants through strong emotional reactions.\nKeep an eye out for the “flavor of the day”—new products, divisions, or concepts that captivate public interest, compelling analysts to discard traditional models and recalculate profit projections. Biotech firms and small- to mid-sized tech companies are particularly abundant sources of such compelling story stocks.\nCarefully manage risks during trade entries and exits To ensure the success of a momentum strategy, it’s crucial to thoroughly address the risk factors involved. Common pitfalls in momentum trading include:\nEntering a position prematurely, before the momentum move is fully confirmed. Exiting a position too late, after the market has reached saturation. Neglecting to monitor the market, leading to missed shifts in trends, reversals, or unexpected news events. Holding a position overnight, exposing it to external influences after market hours that can cause significant price and pattern changes the next day. Delaying action on a losing position, inadvertently following the momentum in the wrong direction. Managing Your Position Mastering position management takes practice, as securities well-suited for momentum trades often have wide bid/ask spreads. These spreads require more substantial price movements to generate profits, and the large intraday fluctuations can trigger stop-losses, even if the overall trend remains intact. Carefully select your holding period, as risk escalates with longer positions.\nSecuring Profits Take profits when the price surges into an overextended technical state. This is often indicated by a sequence of vertical bars on a 60-minute chart or when the price breaches the third or fourth standard deviation of a top or bottom 20-day Bollinger Band.\nConsider tightening stop-losses or executing a blind exit upon reaching key technical levels, such as a major trendline or a previous high/low. Partial profit-taking or exiting altogether is prudent when indicators suggest potential trend reversals.\nAdvantages of Momentum Investing Momentum investing can yield significant returns for traders who possess the right temperament, can manage the associated risks, and remain committed to the strategy.\nShort-Term High Profit Potential: Momentum investing offers the chance for substantial gains over short periods. For example, buying a stock at $50 and selling at $75 based on an overoptimistic analyst report could generate a 50% return before the stock corrects. Over time, the cumulative profit potential can be immense.\nExploiting Market Volatility: Momentum investors thrive on volatile market trends, targeting stocks on the rise and selling before prices decline. Staying ahead of the curve allows for maximum return on investment.\nCapitalizing on Emotional Market Behavior: Instead of being swayed by emotions like many investors, momentum traders profit from price changes driven by emotional decisions, relying on discipline and predefined entry and exit points.\nDisadvantages of Momentum Investing However, momentum investing comes with its challenges, as the risk-return trade-off inherent to all strategies applies here as well.\nRisk of Poor Timing: Like riding ocean waves, a mistimed purchase can leave an investor stranded. Most momentum traders accept this risk in pursuit of higher returns.\nHigh Turnover Costs: Frequent trading can lead to substantial fees, which remain a concern for new investors despite low-cost brokerage options.\nTime-Intensive Approach: Momentum investing requires constant monitoring of market updates, often on a daily or hourly basis, to quickly respond to news or trends that could influence stock prices.\nMarket Sensitivity: Momentum strategies are more effective in bull markets, where investor herding behavior is more pronounced. In bear markets, increased caution among investors reduces profit margins.\nETFs There are several alternatives that enable retail investors to access momentum strategies without requiring hands-on management.\nMomentum ETFs: A Passive Solution Momentum-focused ETFs apply rules-based methodologies to identify and invest in stocks with strong price momentum, effectively streamlining and automating the momentum investment approach.\nInvestopedia has built a chart listing some of the ETFs that people can consider.\nSymbol Description MTUM Tracks an index of large/mid cap U.S. stocks with higher price momentum. MMTM The fund invests at least 80% of its assets in the index, which reweights the S\u0026P Composite 1500 Index to overweight stocks with strong momentum and underweight those with weak momentum. The fund is non-diversified. PDP The fund invests at least 90% of its assets in the underlying index, which includes about 100 securities selected from the largest 1,000 by market capitalization in the NASDAQ U.S. benchmark index. SPMO The fund invests at least 90% of its assets in the underlying index, which includes around 100 S\u0026P 500® stocks with the highest “momentum score.” Momentum investing focuses on securities with strong recent performance. The fund is non-diversified. I recommend SPMO!\n","wordCount":"1133","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-03-17T00:20:35-04:00","dateModified":"2025-03-17T00:20:35-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/momentum-trading/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Sridhar quick notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Momentum Trading</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-03-17 00:20:35 -0400 EDT'>March 17, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1133 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Me&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/ssathya/hugo-static-app/blob/main/content/posts/Momentum%20Trading.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>At first glance, momentum investing appears more like a reflexive response to market trends than a deliberate investing strategy.
