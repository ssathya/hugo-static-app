I recently purchased a Hisense freezer from Costco that can double as a refrigerator. Switching modes isn't very intuitive, and I don't do it frequently. Rather than referencing the manual every time, I thought extracting the key information and sharing it on my blog would be helpful.

## Display Controls

Controlling the Hisense freezer/refrigerator involves understanding the standby mode. To enter or exit this mode, simply press and hold the power button for at least 3 seconds. When in standby mode, the temperature area will display 'OF', other icons will be extinguished, and other key functions will be disabled. Pressing the button again will restore the original control state, exiting the standby mode.

### Controlling temperature
#### Switching between Freezer/Fridge
The Freezer/Fridge conversion button is the key to switching between the two modes. By pressing and holding it for 3 seconds, you can easily switch from freezer to fridge and vice versa. After the switch, the lights will briefly go out, then turn on or flash once. This is a normal indication that the control system has successfully executed the switch.

#### Temperature Control
Press the TEMP button to adjust the temperature to your preferred level. In freezer mode, you can modify the temperature between 7°F and 11°F. In refrigerator mode, you can set the temperature from 36°F to 46°F.

#### Door Alarm
If the door remains open for over two minutes, the alarm will activate thrice every minute. This audio alert will cease after eight minutes. 

#### Energy Saving
This function enables the refrigerator to operate in a power-saving mode, which is beneficial for reducing energy consumption when you're away.  To activate energy-saving mode, press the "Energy Saving" button for three seconds until it lights up. In this mode, the temperature is set to 43°F in the refrigerator and 1°F in the freezer. 

#### Super Freeze/Cool
_I'm not going to use this mode._
