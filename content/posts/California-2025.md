# Trip to Yosemite National Park

> In June 2025, we had a fantastic opportunity to explore Yosemite National Park. It was a delightful two-day adventure, and we’re excited to share some notes about our journey and all the fun things we did.

Let's begin with day one. On June 19th, Veena and I had the pleasure of visiting this lovely park together with Chandrasekar Vemula. We started our day early from his house and arrived at the park around 10:30 or 11:00 A.M., eager for a wonderful day ahead.

Even though I did some homework and made a list of things to do at the park, I didn't realize just how big it was. I was surprised to find out that most of the attractions are *more than an hour's drive* from the entrance!

## Tuolumne Grove

Tuolumne Grove is a serene pocket of Yosemite National Park where you can walk among **giant sequoias**, some of the largest and oldest living trees on Earth. Nestled near Crane Flat along Tioga Road, this grove is home to about two dozen mature sequoias, including the famous **Dead Giant Tunnel Tree**, which was tunneled through in 1878 to attract tourists.

The hike to the grove is a 2.5-mile round-trip that descends approximately 500 feet through a forest of sugar pines and white firs. It’s a moderately challenging trail—easy on the way down, but a bit of a workout coming back up. Unlike the more crowded Mariposa Grove, Tuolumne offers a quieter, more contemplative experience.

## Bridalveil Fall

Next we headed towards Yosemite Falls and on the way we came across the Bridalveil Fall. Bridalveil Fall is one of Yosemite National Park’s most iconic and accessible waterfalls, plunging 620 feet (189 meters) from a hanging valley into Yosemite Valley below. It’s often the first waterfall visitors see when entering the park, especially from the famous Tunnel View overlook.

The fall flows throughout the year, reaching its peak in spring when snowmelt nourishes Bridalveil Creek. On windy days, the water is blown sideways, forming a misty veil that gave it its name. The Ahwahneechee people named it Pohono, meaning “Spirit of the Puffing Wind,” due to its ethereal look. Our photos taken there were geo-tagged as Sierra Nevada.
